This directory contains Matlab wrappers for performing image
registration using elastix. 

Elastix (http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/) is an advanced image registration
suite written in C++. There is a link to the manual on the home
page. This link may work (or may be out of date):
http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/download/elastix_manual_v4.5.pdf

There are binaries available here: http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/download_links.php
You will need to download and install elastix for these Matlab wrappers to work. 

The routines for converting Matlab matrices to image files suitable
for elastix were obtained here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29344
